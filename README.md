**Preparation Steps for Whole Slide Images (WSIs) Processing**

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - First and foremost, ensure that `openslide` is properly installed and configured on your system. This library is essential for handling WSIs.
   - Additionally, install `pma_python` to interact with Pathomation software for digital microscopy.

2. **Converting WSIs:**
   - For WSIs saved in the `.mds` format, utilize the `convert2tiff.py` script to convert them to TIFF format. This conversion is crucial for compatibility with most image processing tools.

3. **Analyzing WSIs:**
   - To examine the layers within WSIs, run the `openslidetest1.py` script. This script allows you to print out and inspect the different layers of the images.

Ensure all dependencies and libraries are correctly installed before proceeding with the scripts above for a smooth and efficient workflow.
